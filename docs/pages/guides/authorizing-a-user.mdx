# Authorizing a User
We've now got expo fitbit intergrated in our project, so let's let users sign in with their fitbit account:

<Steps>
### Retrieve `promptAsync` from `useFitbitProvider`
```tsx
const {
    promptAsync
} = useFitbitProvider();
```
### Add it to your button
```tsx
<Button onPress={() => promptAsync()}>Log in with Fitbit</Button>
```
<Callout type="info">
In some cases you may want to disable the button if there is a user currently logged in, you can do this by retrieving `isLoggedIn` from `useFitbitProvider()`
</Callout>

</Steps>
